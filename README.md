- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for mobile, web, and iOS.
- **Modern UI:** Built with Material UI for a contemporary look and feel.
- **RazorPay Integration:** Enables secure and smooth payment processing.
- **Clean Code:** Organized JavaScript code with a well-structured folder layout.

### **Requirements**
- Strong knowledge of JavaScript.
- Experience with React, Redux, Redux Thunk, and Context API.
- Familiarity with Express and the MVC architecture.
- Basic understanding of MongoDB and Mongoose.

### **Steps to Set Up the Repository**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Open your terminal and clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
     ```
   - Navigate into the repository folder:
     ```bash
     cd your-repo
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - **Client Side:**
     - Navigate to the `client` folder:
       ```bash
       cd client
       ```
     - Install the required packages:
       ```bash
       npm install
       ```
   - **Server Side:**
     - Open a new terminal window or tab and navigate to the `server` folder:
       ```bash
       cd server
       ```
     - Install the server dependencies:
       ```bash
       npm install
       ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the appropriate directory (commonly in the `server` folder) if the project uses environment variables.
   - Add your own configuration details, such as:
     ```env
     MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
     RAZORPAY_KEY=your-razorpay-key
     RAZORPAY_SECRET=your-razorpay-secret
     ```
   - Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.

4. **Start the Development Servers:**
   - **Client:**
     - From the `client` directory, start the React development server:
       ```bash
       npm start
       ```
     - The client will typically run at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
   - **Server:**
     - From the `server` directory, start the Node.js server:
       ```bash
       npm start
       ```
     - The server will usually run at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

5. **Test the Setup:**
   - Open your browser and navigate to the client URL ([http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)) to view the application.
   - Check the terminal outputs for any errors or warnings, and address them as needed.
